Host: Welcome. Today, we’re introducing a new way to tackle one of the toughest challenges in professional organizations: writing proposals.

We all know the struggle—blank pages, endless reports, pressure to get every detail right. It’s time-consuming, stressful, and mistakes can be costly. But what if AI could take on the heavy lifting, while you stay in control?

**(Slight Pause)**

That’s where our application comes in. It’s not just a writing tool—it’s an intelligent partner, built on two levels of knowledge management.

First: Knowledge Cards. With the help of AI, you can turn critical reports, webpages, or datasets into structured cards that capture essential insights. But here’s the key—every card is reviewed and approved by you, the expert. The result? A reliable, human-verified knowledge base your whole team can trust.

Second: Proposal Generation. When it’s time to draft, you simply pick the relevant Knowledge Cards. The system applies the right donor template, and the AI generates text that’s grounded in your verified content—not vague prompts or guesswork.

The benefits are clear:

 - Less risk of AI “hallucination.”

 - Consistent, on-message proposals.

 - Faster, more efficient writing.

**(Slight Pause)**

And the system doesn’t stop there. With built-in peer review, it continuously learns from every approved proposal—adapting over time to your organization’s evolving standards.

The result? Better proposals, faster. Lower risk, higher quality. And always with human accountability.

This is the future of professional proposal writing: a seamless collaboration between human expertise and artificial intelligence.

And here’s the best part: the application follows United Nations Open Source principles, ensuring transparency and minimizing costs for organizations worldwide.
