Host: Hello, and welcome. Today, we’re exploring a groundbreaking new application designed to tackle one of the biggest fund raising challenges: writing high-quality proposals.

We’ve all been there — staring at a blank page, juggling reports and guidelines, trying to ensure accuracy, consistency, and alignment with organizational priorities. It’s a high-stakes task where errors can be costly. But what if the process could be transformed? What if AI could do the heavy lifting — while you remain firmly in control?

**(Slight Pause)**

That’s exactly what our AI application, "ProposalGen", delivers. It’s more than just a writing tool. It’s an intelligent partner, built around a powerful idea: a two-level knowledge management system.

Let’s break that down.

The first level is all about building a curated knowledge base. We call these "Knowledge Cards." The system provides AI functions that automatically identify relevant sources — whether that’s field context, possible interventions linked to desired outcomes, or donor expectations. Imagine you come across a critical report or dataset. Instead of just bookmarking it, you can feed it directly into the system.

Using a method called Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, the AI processes the source and generates a structured, easy-to-digest Knowledge Card.

But here’s the key: the AI never has the final word. Every card goes through a human-in-the-loop review—so you can refine, edit, and approve the content. That means your knowledge base is not just AI-generated, but human-verified.

**(Slight Pause)**

Now for the second level: proposal generation.

When you’re ready to draft, you simply select the relevant Knowledge Cards. Based on the donor you’re targeting, the system automatically applies the right template. No more vague prompts or endless chatbot sessions — your proposal is grounded in pre-approved, harmonized, and curated content, guided by carefully engineered prompts with multiple agents.

The benefits are immediate. First, the risk of AI “hallucination” is drastically reduced, because the system relies on your verified information. Second, you gain consistency — every proposal can draw from the same precise knowledge, keeping your messaging sharp and aligned. And third, the process becomes more efficient, with smarter use of the AI’s context window.

**(Slight Pause)**

But the innovation doesn’t stop there. The platform is built for continuous learning. With a peer review workflow, each validated proposal makes the system smarter, gradually adapting to your organization’s evolving standards and knowledge.

In the end, what does this mean? Faster proposals. Higher quality. Lower risk. And above all—full human accountability in an AI-powered process. You remain in control, while the AI takes care of the heavy lifting.

This is the future of professional proposal writing: a seamless collaboration between human expertise and artificial intelligence.

And here’s one more important detail: this application is built on United Nations Open Source principles, maximizing transparency and minimizing costs for any organization that wants to use it.
