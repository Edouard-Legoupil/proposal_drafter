      "Strictly base all content on provided inputs; do not invent or infer missing data. If unavailable, write: 'Information not provided in the context.'",
      "Use a formal, objective, analytical tone. Avoid advocacy language. Keep entries concise and evidence-based.",
      "Use organization names and outcome names, never internal IDs. Use field_context names, never IDs.",
      "Currency: Provide budgets in QAR or USD as instructed. Specify exchange rates in the budget narrative when applicable.",
      "Administration fee: 7% on total direct + support costs; borne by principal partner. Sub-partner admin costs are not applicable. The principal partner shares this fee with downstream partners from its own portion.",
      "Support costs: ≤15% of Total Direct Costs (DC). Total support costs plus all staff costs (programme + support) ≤30% of DC. Maintain 70% DC / 30% support ceiling overall.",
      "M&E costing: Budget M&E as a separate output; reference value about 5% (case-by-case). Ensure the LogFrame outcome indicators and M&E plan align with QFFD’s Managing for Results (MfR) approach.",
      "Budget hygiene: No lump sums. Each budget line must include: unit type, quantity, unit cost, duration/recurrence, % charged to QFFD, and a budget narrative linking to activities and outcomes. Flag each line as Direct (D) or Support (S).",
      "BoQ rule: Any unit or total cost line ≥ 4,000 USD requires a detailed Bill of Quantities (BoQ) in a single workbook (sheets named by budget line, totals matching the template).",
      "Budget discipline: Budget changes >5% at any cost component require prior approval and a revised budget. No adding/deleting lines post-signature without approval. Up to 120% reporting against a head requires written justification and prior approval. Unspent funds are deducted from next instalment; final-year unspent must be returned. Carry-forward requires prior notification/approval.",
      "Financial reporting: Submit quarterly/semi-annual/annual as requested; QFFD reviews before releasing instalments. Maintain complete supporting documentation for audits (petty cash, cash/voucher assistance, loans/grants to beneficiaries, HR/payroll/timesheets, procurement and payments, travel, rentals, office costs, shared costs, agreements, reviews).",
      "Risk & compliance: Maintain a risk register, track likelihood/impact, define mitigation/contingencies, and report regularly. Adhere to legal/regulatory requirements and PPA terms; provide compliance and progress reports as specified.",
      "MfR lifecycle framing (analysis → planning → monitoring → evaluation → reporting) governs the entire template:",
      "• Step 1 — Initial Situation Analysis: Conduct problem analysis (e.g., problem tree), stakeholder analysis (interests, influence), and prioritize stakeholders. Output: succinct statements feeding Context and Relevance.",
      "• Step 2 — Assessment & Prioritization of Approaches: Convert problem tree to objective tree; evaluate alternative approaches (chances for success, sustainability, social compatibility, coherence, capacities, cost-benefit, political acceptance).",
      "• Step 3 — Result Chain: Articulate IF/AND/THEN hypotheses from outputs → outcomes → impacts; list external assumptions (risks outside project control) separately from programmatic risks (inside project control).",
      "• Step 4 — Project Strategy & LogFrame: Build the LogFrame (hierarchy of objectives, indicators, MoV, assumptions). Indicators must be SMART with baselines and targets.",
      "• Step 5 — Project Organization: Define strategic/operational arrangements, roles and responsibilities (HQ/field), steering and decision-making, supervision/control, MEL, reporting, and communications.",
      "Indicators: Select as few as possible and as many as necessary. Include baselines (initial values), time-bound targets, and clear MoV. Prefer mixed-methods where appropriate and use standard/SDG indicators if suitable.",
      "Baselines & reference points: If baseline data are missing at submission, specify the plan to generate baselines (method, timing, responsibilities). Benchmarks/comparison groups improve interpretability; only counterfactual designs support strong attribution claims.",
      "Monitoring system: Define what, when, who, and how data are collected, analyzed, interpreted, and used for steering. Ensure timeliness, quality, appropriate methods, sufficiency, and reasonable costs.",
      "Outcome-focused steering: Use monitoring findings for adaptive management (compare targets, baselines, trends; analyze context; revise activities/resources accordingly).",
      "Evaluation: Preplan independent mid-term/final evaluations where relevant; use OECD-DAC criteria (relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability) as applicable.",
      "Results reporting: Shift from activity/output listings to results (outcomes), context changes/risks, challenges and solutions, and learning. Provide concise reports aligned with QFFD templates.",
      "Executive Summary Arabic requirement: Provide a short Arabic paragraph covering project name, total budget, duration, total beneficiaries, objectives, and expected results."
