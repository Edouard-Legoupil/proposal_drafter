Data controller’s role for projects is established on country, regional, or HQ level - depending on the territorial scope of the project. On country level, the role of Data controller belongs to country representative. - Data processing: UNHCR adheres to the 8 data protection principles established in the Policy for the collection and further processing of personal data of persons of concern. These principles are reflected in the key documents that guide UNHCR core mandate activities, including Guidance on Registration and Identity Management. - Risk assessment: The UNHCR Data Protection Policy and Guidance forms part of a risk management framework to identify and address the risks associated with the processing of personal data of persons of concern by UNHCR, its partners and other relevant third parties, and to outline appropriate mitigating measures. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is part of this risk management framework and is foreseen for new technologies, systems for data processing, projects or policies, and data sharing arrangements that may negatively impact on the protection of personal data of UNHCR persons of concern. UNHCR employs internal tools to map operational data lifecycle and assess where the processing meets a threshold for DPIA. DPIA is required when developing new data processing systems and new technologies, and where collection and processing or sharing of personal data is likely to be large, repeated or structural; and for the sharing of particularly sensitive personal data with a third party. DPIA is strongly recommended for sharing of personal data with a partner or third party with presumed data protection weaknesses or where the level of data protection is difficult to assess. DPIA may be recommended in the processing of particularly sensitive personal data as defined in the Data Protection Guidance. The Data Controller determines the need for DPIA, oversees the assessment process, signs off on the report and makes decisions with regards to the data processing initiative and the necessary mitigating measures. - Risk mitigation: When sharing personal data of persons of concern with third parties, UNHCR employs technical and organisational measures to ensure security, confidentiality and integrity of personal data, and has procedures in place to assess whether the third party adheres to comparable standards. Data sharing agreements are entered into with third parties in cases where the sharing of personal data is large, repeated and structural. "

UNHCR and partners strengthen GBV and child protection through awareness campaigns, PSEA measures, and referral pathways for legal, medical, and psychosocial services in BAY states. \n - Prevention and mitigation of negative effects: AGD principles guide all sectors to prevent protection risks for vulnerable groups. UNHCR works with partners to assess capacity, implement PSEA, and ensure accountability and transparency, embedding inclusive approaches for women, children, older persons, and persons with disabilities in program design and delivery. \n - Adequate participation: Meaningful participation is central to AGD.

Besides promoting participatory approaches to programming, our policy covers other key elements including Communication and Transparency, to ensure that forcibly displaced and stateless persons receive information in a timely manner, in their most preferred and accessible way, in order to mitigate protection risks and promote access to available services. Additionally, our policy highlights the importance of building effective feedback and response Mechanisms to ensure the appropriate management of forcibly displaced and stateless persons concerns and complaints - including those linked to fraud and sexual exploitation and abuse - and to adapt its programs, based on feedback received from people. UNHCR utilizes a diverse set of feedback and complaint mechanisms and tools in camps and urban areas. These include complaint and feedback boxes, information feedback points at community centers and networks of community-based structures. They enable forcibly displaced and stateless populations to communicate complaints and ideas regarding their experience of UNHCR or partner services and interventions.

Such funds are thus allocated, as and when they are pledged and received, to the different operations according to requirements. Therefore, UNHCR can only state the identity of all donors to a specific operation once its annual accounts are closed.
