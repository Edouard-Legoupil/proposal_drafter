Through strategic oversight and investigation services, the work of IGO helps deter fraud and abuse and improve the efficiency of UNHCR's programmes and operations. It contributes to the integrity of the organization and its accountability towards the people UNHCR protects, host communities, donors and other stakeholders. IGO's Investigation Service is responsible for receiving and assessing misconduct complaints related to UNHCR personnel, partner staff, vendors or contractors. Where appropriate, the Investigation Service conducts investigations into allegations of misconduct. Within UNHCR, it has the sole authority to do so. It also gathers, collates, processes and analyses information in order to detect or disrupt misconduct and prevent or mitigate risks thereof. These risks could be operational, financial, organizational/reputational, managerial or cyber-related in nature. In addition, UNHCR has an Independent Audit and Oversight Committee (IAOC) that is an expert advisory body established by UNHCR's Standing Committee in 2011 to assist the High Commissioner and the Executive Committee in exercising their oversight responsibilities in accordance with relevant best practices, industry standards, and the financial and staff regulations and rules applicable to UNHCR. It aims to 1) provide external, independent, senior-level advice regarding the functioning of audit and oversight in UNHCR; 2) review internal and external audit and oversight matters; and 3) review financial management and reporting within UNHCR. The Strategic Oversight Service under IGO is to strengthen the organization-wide response to oversight findings and facilitate coherence of all oversight functions by ensuring that there are no gaps or duplications. The Service is responsible for communication and coordination with internal and external oversight providers. In this context, the Service manages the relationship with the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which carries out internal audits and advisories. It also acts as the focal point for the UN Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) and provides secretariat support for IAOC. Strategic Oversight also undertakes strategic analysis of oversight findings and conducts specific reviews and inquiries as appropriate. ."

UNHCR's Division of Emergency, Security and Supply (DESS) comprises the Supply Management Service (SMS) to support this effort. They are responsible for global supply chain management, operational support, planning and reporting on the use of resources. This includes the procurement of goods and services to support field operations and headquarters, the provision of logistical support to field operations, as well as warehouse, stockpile, fleet, and asset management. UNHCR maintains a global network of warehouses in strategic locations around the world (Accra, Amman, Copenhagen, Douala, Dubai, Nairobi, Panama City, and Termez) with stockpiles of essential emergency relief items. This means that when an emergency is declared anywhere, UNHCR is ready to deliver life-saving items like tents and blankets by road, sea or air for up to one million people. UNHCR also prepositions and manages regional and local stocks to scale up humanitarian assistance when needed. Furthermore, UNHCR deploys supply chain specialists who are trained in crisis situations and help establish or reinforce the supply infrastructure to ensure people's basic needs and long-term assistance. In the context of UNHCR's Business Transformation Programme and the adoption of a new Enterprise Resource Planning System (Cloud ERP), procurement management processes have been streamlined and integrated into one single platform, enhancing efficiencies and controls. External partners, such as suppliers, are now involved in processes supported by Cloud ERP. UNHCR is implementing a new Supply Operating Model, which aims to recalibrate roles and responsibilities between UNHCR global, regional and local supply teams, ensuring that UNHCR's day-to-day supply processes are aligned with its strategic objectives. UNHCR has strengthened the functional oversight of supply teams in the regional bureaux and helped ensure the second line of support to operations. UNHCR has zero tolerance for fraud, corruption, and other forms of misconduct. It expects the highest standards of ethics and integrity from suppliers and UNHCR personnel in UNHCR's procurement processes. UNHCR will ensure (i) potential suppliers are treated equally, fairly and without favoritism, including the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest; and (ii) processes are established to vet potential suppliers, and monitor that suppliers uphold standards set out in the UN Supplier Code of Conduct.
