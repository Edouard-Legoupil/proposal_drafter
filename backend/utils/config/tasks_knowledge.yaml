  description: "For the given section name and instructions, find the most relevant information from the knowledge base. The section name is '{section_name}' and the instructions are '{instructions}'. For each piece of evidence found, you MUST classify it according to the Evidence Classification Guide and include this classification alongside the source URL in the following format: '[Full Document/Organization Name - Evidence Type] (source URL)'. Only use the evidence types specified in the guide."
  expected_output: "A bulleted list of key findings and supporting evidence from the knowledge base that directly addresses the instructions for the section. Each finding must include: 1) The finding or data point, 2) a key precise quote from the source, 3) The classified source in the format '[Full Document/Organization Name - Evidence Type](url)'"

write_task:
  description: "Using the research findings, write the content for the section '{section_name}'. The instructions for this section are: '{instructions}'. You must incorporate evidence classifications in ALL citations using the format: '[Full Document/Organization Name - Evidence Type](url)'. When presenting evidence in tables, include an 'Evidence Source Type' column classifying each piece of evidence. Your response must be only the text for the section, without any additional titles or formatting. Be sure to cite all sources with their full names and evidence classifications."
  expected_output: "A well-written, clear, and concise text that fulfills all the requirements of the section instructions, with key quote and properly classified citations for all sources in the format '[Full Document/Organization Name - Evidence Type](url)'."

      - "For donor documents: Specify whether it's a strategy (funding priorities) or guidelines (operational requirements)"
      - "For annual reports: These typically contain program results data, not primary research"
