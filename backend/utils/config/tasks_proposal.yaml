    Generate content for "{section}" based on the following:
    - **Project Description:** {project_description}
    - **Form Data:** {form_data}
    - **Special Requirements:** {special_requirements}
    - **Instructions:** {instructions}
    IMPORTANT: The response must not exceed {limit_value} {limit_term}s. If the output exceeds the limit, you MUST truncate or summarize so the final output fits the limit. Failure to comply will require regeneration.
    Respond with a raw JSON object, no Markdown formatting, no triple backticks.

    Return a JSON with the following format:
      {
        "generated_content": "<Generated proposal section>",
        "evaluation_status": "",
        "feedback": ""
      }

    "generated_content" should contain a well-written section of the project proposal that strictly follows the given instructions and does not exceed {limit_value} {limit_term}s.
    Leave "evaluation_status" and "feedback" as empty strings for now.

  description: >
    Review the generated content for the "{section}" and verify it against the JSON instructions: {instructions}.
    Ensure that the content does NOT exceed {limit_value} {limit_term}s.
    
    If the content meets the requirements, approve it.
    If the content is too long, provide feedback asking for a shorter version within the limit.
    Respond with a raw JSON object, no Markdown formatting, no triple backticks.

  expected_output: >
    Return a JSON with the following format:
    {
      "generated_content": "<Copy original content or revised if minor edits>",
      "evaluation_status": "Approved" OR "Requires Revision",
      "feedback": "<Only if revision is required, provide constructive feedback>"
    }

    Approve only if the content aligns with the instructions and does not exceed the {limit_value} {limit_term}s.

    Regenerate content for "{section}" based on the following:
    - **Project Description:** {project_description}
    - **Form Data:** {form_data}
    - **User's Concise Input:** {concise_input}
    - **Special Requirements:** {special_requirements}
    - **Instructions:** {instructions}

    Ensure that the response integrates the user’s input while remaining structured, coherent, and within {limit_value} {limit_term}s.
    If the output exceeds the limit, rephrase or summarize to fit within the given limit.
    Respond with a raw JSON object, no Markdown formatting, no triple backticks.

  expected_output: >
    Return a JSON with the following format:

    The revised content must be coherent, respect the word limit, and align with both the project context and evaluator's feedback.
